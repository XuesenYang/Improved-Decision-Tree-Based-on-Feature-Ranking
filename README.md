# Improved-Decision-Tree-Based-on-Feature-Ranking
An improved decision tree classifier, in which the feature ranking threshold is used to replace Gini coefficient or information gain rate, as a criterion for judging whether a feature can be used as a tree node.

# File description         
(1)  main.m is the major operating documents. Bayesian parameter optimization is added.   
(2)  build_tree.m is used to constructed decision tree.         
(3)  DT_FR.m combine Decision Tree and Characteristic Sorting.         
(4)  FeatureRank.m generates feature ranking.        
(5)  predict.m  is used to predict data.    
(6)  discreteOrContinue.m is used to judge whether features are discrete or not.       
(7)  C4_5.m  represents Classification Process of Decision Tree.
